# Portfolio_clean

Started coding: dec, 2018.

After 1 week in the Bootcamp in january 2019, we were assigned to make a modern portfolio to publish our projects on and show to world who you are. 

I followed a really learningfull video of traversy media. 

This was the first time i worked with SASS. I had to set it all back to regular CSS because i couldn't put it online on Heroku somehow. 

I tryed to make the example from travesy media as personal as i could. And added and changed some things here and there. Overal, im happy with the result. 

The landingpage, is a guy standing on a car watching to the stars. Which has the meaning as in, learning to code will always expend just as the universe. You never done learning. Beside that, I really like watching to the stars, so the background fitted exactly for my purpose. 

Ive added some information about myself and the things I like to do. 

The projects page, shows all my projects so far, and beneath i've added my code skills and certificates. 

Will be updating my portfolio regulary as I keep learning more and more everyday.
